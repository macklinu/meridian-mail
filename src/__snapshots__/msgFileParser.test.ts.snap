  "body": "Your character has been deemed ready to take on the world without my protection, meaning that you may now raise your sword against other players if you so desire.  It is with a heavy heart that I take my leave of you, but I trust that you will do fine without me.

You also have many other rights and responsibilities available to you.  You can now join a guild with other friends.  Guilds are a good way to gain protection from those that would do you harm.  Joining a good guild will make the difference between merely surviving or thriving in the world.  Guilds can also get into wars with other guilds, so be careful that you don't make too many enemies.

You can also participate in the politics of Meridian.  In the royal city of Barloque there is a clerk named Caramo which handles the election of the position of Justicar.  The Justicar pardons those that have been flagged as outlaws and murderers.  Unless you wish to see such villians get pardons, it is important to be active in voting.

I must warn you that engaging in lethal combat against other players may soil your good name.  If you strike an innocent, or cast a spell which harms him, you may be branded an outlaw, an onus which only fades upon your death.  If you slay an innocent in cold blood, you will be blacklisted as a murderer, and this is a weight upon your soul which does not easily depart.  This puts you at risk:  since murderers and outlaws are not innocents, one may attack them without being named a murderer or an outlaw.

Also note that assisting an outlaw or murder by casting helpful spells upon them will brand you an outlaw in the eyes of society.  You must choose your friends and your enemies well!

If you do not wish to engage in the unsavory practice of attacking innocents or assisting the unlawful, it is heartily recommended that you do not enable attacking innocents in your game preferences.  This is also called your \\"safety\\" since it keeps you safe from being outcast as an unlawful outlaw or murderer.  While your safety is on, you are not permitted to either attack innocents or cast spells that are hostile to them.  This can be crucial when one stray sword blow can make you an outlaw.  However, rest assured that you will always be permitted to strike outlaws and murderers, since it is crucial that you always have the option of defending yourself from their treacherous ways.

Your safety is currently on, meaning you cannot cast hostile spells or attack innocent players.

Finally, some last bits of advice as I depart.  Do not dispair if you are sent to the underworld by some monster or even another player.  Death is part of the cycle, and learning to recover from death is important.  Put some items away in the vault in Barloque for times when you find yourself killed and unable to get items from your corpse.  Also, ask politely for assistance and you will often find someone willing to lend a helping hand.  Make some friends and you will find that nothing is truly beyond your reach.

Have fun in Meridian!

  "body": "Oh, most worthy adventurer.  Tales of your exploits have been oft told here at the Court, and recently, the Meridian Council itself declared you to possess considerable promise. Perhaps someday you will be given the honor of studying and guarding one of the Five Tokens.

The Council serves our fair land by using their acquired knowledge to benefit daily life. For the most part, they are honest and impartial in their decisions - guided by the Priestess of Shal'ille. However, Duke Akardius and Princess Kateriina and their factions of followers try to sway the Council down differing paths:

Duke Akardius wishes for more of the Council's energies to be used for the benefit of commerce and the study of lore, while the Princess seeks their aid in advancing knowledge of magic. Both believe their path is the way to reduce the plague of monsters which terrify the land these days.

There are also boorish tales of a third faction of rebels.  They are dissatisfied with the current political climate and seek to bring their leader to rule our lands.  I do not know much about these rebels, nor do I care to learn anything.  You are on your own if you wish to learn about them.

Should you desire to join any of these factions, seek the Liege. As a faction member, you can help to influence the Council yourself, and share in the benefits of belonging to the party in power. You will need to demonstrate fealty to your Liege on a regular basis to keep your name on the rolls. Even if you join neither faction, you will still be influenced by the Council's decisions - as are all.

Fair partings, and perhaps we will someday meet at the court.

  "body": "You have suffered some penalties for logging off in an unsafe area:
You lost 0 items, 0 spell points, and 0 skill points.

In the future, it would be wise to log off in a safe area such as an inn, an adventurer's hall, or the interior of your guild's hall.

Abandoning your body in an unsafe area weakens it, which may cause you to suffer some of the effects of death: you could lose proficiency in spells and skills, as well as loosening your grip on items in your possession.  You have a 10 minute grace period after logoff before penalties are incurred, so if you lose your connection involuntarily, simply reconnect within 10 minutes and your character will be fine.  Every time you log off unsafely in a short period of time, your body becomes progressively weaker and as such will suffer more from being abandoned.  The first time you logoff unsafely, you will suffer little or no penalties, but once you have performed enough unsafe logoffs, the damage to your body will be comparable to the losses incurred when your character dies.  This penalty escalation recedes over time, so if you don't log off unsafely too frequently, your character should suffer only mild if any penalties.

I recommend you do not use this as a tactic to avoid danger, since it could work against you should your connection to the Meridian become too unstable soon after.
